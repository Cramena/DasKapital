SCE_001,How does our economic system model our society ?
SCE_002,"The goal of this game is to answer that question, to do that, let's describe this system: it is based on two main pillars."
SCE_003,"The first one is <b>the market economy</b>, the second one is <b>the <color=#3DB39E>private property</color> of the <color=#FFD400>means of production</color></b>. No need to know about these notions beforehand, we are going to explore them together."
SCE_004,Let's start with the markets. A market is a place where people exchange <b>commodities</b>: goods and services that may be exchanged.
SCE_005,Every commodity has two characteristics which determine its global value: they are its <b>use value</b> (what it can be used for) and its exchange value (which determines *how much it is worth* on a market).
SCE_006,"As an example: this is an apple, an apple is a commodity."
SCE_007,Every commodity's characteristics are noted on a sheet. Here is the apple's sheet.
SCE_008,"First there is its use value: it is edible, sweet. All of the apple's useful characteristics are noted."
SCE_009,"Then there is its exchange value, which we set at 1 coin. We can trade an apple for another commodity with the same exchange value."
SCE_010,"It is determined by the *workload necessary to its production*. The bigger the workload (longer, more intense), the bigger the exchange value."
SCE_011,"For our example, it is defined by the work necessary to grow and harvest an apple."
SCE_012,"So we have our first example of a commodity, an apple, with a use value and an exchange value."
SCE_013,"To explore our economic system, let's immerse ourselves in it : we will follow someone who just inherited and became the owner of a restaurant."
SCE_014,"In order to start an activity in restauration, our owner will first have to get some tools and ingrédients."
SCE_015,"This is their commodities stock, everything in it belongs to them."
SCE_016,Leave your mouse on a commodity to display its sheet. Try it!
SCE_017,"Great! We can see here the informations that we reviewed earlier. Now, we will introduce another stock."
SCE_018,"This is a stranger stock, it belongs to someone else."
SCE_019,"Click on a commodity, keep pressing your button and move your mouse above a tile <b>of the same stock</b>. Try it!"
SCE_020,"To trade commodities from one stock to another, we will need a market!"
SCE_021,"Here's a market interface! In the left 'basket', we put the commodities we want to give, and in the right one, we put those we want to get."
SCE_022,"In the middle, the scale lets us know which basket has more value."
SCE_023,"When the scale indicates an equality between baskets, you can exchange the commodities by clicking 'Exchange'. Don't forget you can put your mouse on a commodity to see its exchange value."
SCE_024,Try to make a transaction! You can also double click on a commodity to put it in a basket.
SCE_025,"Perfect! We now see how our first pillar functions, the market economy : we exchange commodities or commodity groups of the same value on a market."
SCE_026,"To create a meal, our owner is going to need more tools and ingredients: let's introduce two new stocks."
SCE_027,"Perfect, now that you know how to exchange commodities on a market, try to have the following ungredients in your stock:  3 <size=150%><sprite=0><size=100%>, 2 <size=150%><sprite=1><size=100%>, 2 <size=150%><sprite=4><size=100%>, 2 <size=150%><sprite=5><size=100%>, 1 <size=150%><sprite=2><size=100%>, 1 <size=150%><sprite=12><size=100%> and 1 <size=150%><sprite=17><size=100%>."
SCE_028,"Nicely done! We now have all our tools and ingredients. With the restaurant, they constitute the <b><color=#FFD400>means of production</color></b> of our owner."
SCE_029,"This is the second pillar of our economic system, the '<b><color=#3DB39E>private property</color></b> of the <b><color=#FFD400>means of production</color></b>'. But what does that mean ?"
SCE_030,"The <b><color=#FFD400>means of production</color></b> are all the tools, raw materials and infrastructures needed to produce commodities. Here, they are our utensils, ingredients and restaurant."
SCE_031,"In order to produce a commodity, we just need to put the ingredients inside the restaurant and to press the 'Produce' button."
SCE_032,Essayez de créer un assiette de fruits en plaçant 3 <size=150%><sprite=0><size=100%> dans le restaurant et en appuyant sur le bouton 'Produire'. Vous pouvez double cliquer sur les marchandises pour les placer.
SCE_033,Good job! You just created you first commodity! Put your mouse on the fruit plate to see where its value comes from.
SCE_034,"Here, you can see a new element, the value gauge. It breaks down the value of a commodity according to its source."
SCE_035,"For instance, here, by putting three apples together, we have created a fruit plate, its value is now equal to the sum of the values of three apples, so 3 x 1 = 3."
SCE_036,"Perfect, to continue, we are going to need to use the tools, the tools can be used multiple times before being consumed. Create an orange slice by associating 1 <size=150%><sprite=1><size=100%> and 1 <size=150%><sprite=2><size=100%>."
SCE_037,"Nicely done! As you can see, the knife lost oen use, it only has two left. Now, place your mouse on the prange slice."
SCE_038,"What can we see ? The value of an orange and of one knife use. A knife has a value of 3 and can be used 3 times, so each use has a value of 3 / 3 = 1."
SCE_039,"So, the value of commodities is determined by the value of its ingredients and by a fraction of the value of the tools used, which corresponds to their degradation or their maintenance."
SCE_040,"Before we continue, create a pineapple slice and a watermelon slice to train yourselves."
SCE_041,Perect! But we are still missing an element. We have indeed not yet taken human labor into account!
SCE_042,"Human labor is <b>essential</b> to commodity production. It is what slices and assembles our fruits, but also what allows their harvest in the first place. It can be found behind every commodity."
SCE_043,"Human labor is represented by the <b><color=#FFD400>workforce</color></b> <size=150%><sprite=3><size=100%>, a commodity like any other. It has an exchange value and a use value, and can be exchanged on a market."
SCE_044,"When someone is hired, the person that employs them rents their <b><color=#FFD400>workforce</color></b> for an amount of time."
SCE_045,"In our example, our owner employs a worker who cooks for them, and so they dispose of their <b><color=#FFD400>workforce</color></b> as if it were any other commodity in their stock."
SCE_046,Put your mouse on the <b><color=#FFD400>workforce</color></b> to observe its characteristics.
SCE_047,"As for every commodity, the <b><color=#FFD400>workforce</color></b> has an exchange value."
SCE_048,"Like for a tool, we can consider that it is the maintenance cost of this force. This means that this cost will be used to pay for *everything that is necessary* to the worker."
SCE_049,"We already know that the <b><color=#FFD400>workforce</color></b> enables us to transform commodities, but we observe in its use value a second characteristic."
SCE_050,"Indeed, it adds to the exchange value of the commodity it produces."
SCE_051,"This right here is the singular property of the <b><color=#FFD400>workforce</color></b>, it gives more value than it costs to employ. It is thus one of the only ways to create a profit while respecting *exchange equivalence*."
SCE_052,"This added value is called<b><color=#3DB39E>surplus value</color></b>, and its amount *can vary*. For our example, we will use an arbitrary value."
SCE_053,"Now, try to create a smoothie!"
SCE_054,"Perfect! Once again, place your mouse on the smoothie to check its value gauge."
SCE_055,"We still find tools and ingredients in its value composition, but also two more elements."
SCE_056,"The first one, unsurprisingly, is the cost of maintenance of the <b><color=#FFD400>workforce</color></b>, the salary."
SCE_057,"Its value is calculated like previously for the knife use. The value of a day of <b><color=#FFD400>workforce</color></b> is 6, we can use it three times, it value per use is then 6 / 3 = 2."
SCE_058,"And finally, we have the <b><color=#3DB39E>surplus value</color></b>, which is the added value that comes from using the <b><color=#FFD400>workforce</color></b>."
SCE_059,"Following the exchange equivalence, we spend the value of ingredients, tools and <b><color=#FFD400>workforce</color></b> maintenance (9), which is transmitted to the final product, but we also get a 'bonus' surplus (1)!"
SCE_060,"I f you wish, you may examine our previous products, we have adjusted their value gauges to take the <b><color=#FFD400>workforce</color></b> and the <b><color=#3DB39E>surplus value</color></b> necessary to their creation into account."
SCE_061,"On a étudié la façon dont les marchandises s'échangent, et on sait à présent que leur valeur provient des matières premières, des outils et de la <b><color=#FFD400>force de travail</color></b>. Il ne nous reste plus qu'à étudier la redistribution de cette valeur."
SCE_062,"Let's conclude ou study of our second pillar: 'the <b><color=#3DB39E>private property</color></b> of the <b><color=#FFD400>means of production</color></b>'. We just saw how those <b><color=#FFD400>means of production</color></b> work, let's now look at <b><color=#3DB39E>private property</color></b>."
SCE_063,"This means that <b><color=#FFD400>means of production</color></b> can be owned by one or multiple *people*, who decide - among other things - what is produced, and the way the benefits are distributed."
SCE_064,"In our example, our owner determines the activity and the profits distribution of the restaurant - without necessarily working in it - and they hire someone to produce its commodities."
SCE_065,"We arrive at the end of our journey, we only have to study the redistribution of the value of our commodities onnce sold. To achieve this, we introduce our owner and a resell space."
SCE_066,"By placing a commodity, it is ivided in an amount of coins equal to its exchange value."
SCE_067,"Then, the coins are redistributed between the material (tools, ingredients), the worker, et the owner of the <b><color=#FFD400>means of production</color></b>."
SCE_068,"For our next example, follow the instructions of our owner."
SCE_069,"And <i>voilà</i>! The punch has been divided in 33 coins! They have 3 different colors to differenciate them. Press the button below the stock to redistribute these coins, according to their color."
SCE_070,"The first ones, green, are used to repay the purchase of raw materials and the tools maintenance. This distribution is necessary to acquire and maintain the <b><color=#FFD400>means of production</color></b>!"
SCE_071,Press the button again to distribute the next coins.
SCE_072,"These ones, yellow, pay the salary of the worker: the maintenance of the <b><color=#FFD400>workforce</color></b> employed."
SCE_073,"This distribution stays indispensable, without it, the worker cannot satisfy their needs and regenerate their <b><color=#FFD400>workforce</color></b> the following days."
SCE_074,Press the button one last time to distribute the last coins.
SCE_075,"These coins, which come from the <b><color=#3DB39E>surplus value</color></b> created by the <b><color=#FFD400>workforce</color></b> of the worker, go to our owner."
SCE_076,"They represent the profit made by the creation of the commodity, and it is solely the owner who decides *what to do with it*."
SCE_077,"This is the reason why the owners use someone else's <b><color=#FFD400>workforce</color></b>, it is the only commodity capable of generating profit. This allows them to live exclusively from retrieving that profit."
SCE_078,"<b><color=#3DB39E>private property</color></b> creates two categories of people, those who own the *means of production*, and those who don't."
SCE_079,"The first category has to put the second one to work in its <b><color=#FFD400>means of production</color></b>, and can live off of the profit generated by the <b><color=#3DB39E>surplus value</color></b> of its <b><color=#FFD400>workforce</color></b>. This social class is the <b><color=#3DB39E>bourgeoisie</color></b>."
SCE_080,The second category must necessarily sell its <b><color=#FFD400>workforce</color></b> to the first one to live. This social class is the <b><color=#FFD400>proletariat</color></b>.
SCE_081,"These two classes depend on one another, but have *opposing interests*."
SCE_082,"On one hand, the <b><color=#3DB39E>bourgeoisie</color></b> has an interest in increasing the <b><color=#3DB39E>surplus value</color></b> it reaps, on the other, the <b><color=#FFD400>proletariat</color></b> has an interest in keeping as much value from their work as possible. This is the birth of *class struggle*."
SCE_083,"This unbalanced struggle is inherent to <b><color=#3DB39E>private property</color></b>, as it de facto creates two social classes with incompatible interests."
SCE_084,"If the origin of that antagonism is <b><color=#3DB39E>private property</color></b>, is an alternative conceivable ?"
SCE_085,"In a system where people would not be able to privately own the <b><color=#FFD400>moyens de production</color></b> anymore, this ownership could be split betweenthe people working there. <b>This is collective property</b>."
SCE_086,This is the central point of the project of 19th century socialists: the collectivisation of the <b><color=#FFD400>means of production</color></b> to make class struggle between the <b><color=#3DB39E>bourgeoisie</color></b> and the <b><color=#FFD400>proletariat</color></b> obsolete.
SCE_087,But how is the <b><color=#3DB39E>bourgeoisie</color></b> winning that class struggle ? How does it always extract more and more <b><color=#3DB39E>surplus value</color></b> from the work of the <b><color=#FFD400>proletariat</color></b> ? This is what we will see next time.
SCE_088,"If you wish, you can continue to experiment different recipes, don't forget that the <b><color=#FFD400>force de travail</color></b> is necessary to produce a commodity!"
SCE_089,"By clicking the top left button, you can sitch from the production screen to the market screen to fill your stock back up, and vice versa."
SCE_090,
AST_005,Beware! The exchange value does not necessarily correspond to its price!
AST_010,"This work load can represent the assembly, construction, but also the harvest of commodities."
AST_048,"The value of a commodity is determined by the work necessary to its production, the value of the <b><color=#FFD400>workforce</color></b>is determined by what is necessary to recreate it (food, rest, recreation)."
AST_051,"The equivalence of exchange demands to spend the amount of the exchange value (X). Using it transfers its exchange value (X), and and added value (Y) to the product. This Y is a net gain."
AST_052,The <b><color=#3DB39E>surplus value</color></b> is born of the difference between the value of the maintenance of the <b><color=#FFD400>workforce</color></b>and the value of what it produces in a day. We'll see how it varies next time.
AST_063,"These people only very rarely work in these means of production. They usually bought it, created it or inherited it."
AST_076,"Invest it, keep it, pay rent with it, etc."
AST_078,"Reminder: the <b><color=#FFD400>means of production</color></b> are comprised of all the non human resources necessary to production, here, the restaurant, tools, raw material."
AST_081,"This is strictly a question of interest in a production system. <b>Morale has nothing to do with it</b>, we are not describing a 'good side' or a 'bad side', but the social relationships of domination."
AST_082,"Between the <b><color=#3DB39E>bourgeoisie</color></b>and the <b><color=#FFD400>proletariat</color></b>. Other class struggles have traversed history: the nobility, clergy, peasantry, etc."

DYN_014,Now we're going to sell it!
DYN_015,"Without the means of production, no work!"
DYN_016,We do need the equipment.
DYN_017,We must take care of it.
DYN_018,"I have to rest, eat..."
DYN_019,"Thanks to that, tomorrow I'll still be able to work."
DYN_020,We must take care of you.
